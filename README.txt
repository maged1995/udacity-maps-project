Neighborhood Map(R) version 1.0 08/1/2018
General Usage Notes
-----------------------

- this application has pinpoints of places in Manhattan
- if you click the options button on the top left you'll be provided with options to [search and ]select
- the option you select will open a info window on the pinpoint whose name you selected


Opening
---------
1- extract in the directory you want you want
2- log in to console.developers.google.com
3- add new project (with whatever name you'd like)
4- go to APIs & Services>credentials
5- create credentials>API key>restrict key
6- select HTTP referrers (optional: name your API key)
7- copy the file path (that would be shown on google chrome URL if you run the file on Google Chrome) and paste it into a referrer BUT replace "file:/" with "__file_url__" and save
8- you can run the file now, but the API may take a few minutes work

NB: if the page throws "Oops! Something went wrong. This page didn't load Google Maps correctly. See the JavaScript console for technical details." that means that the API hasn't worked yet and you have to wait for google to apply the API settings after saved, which may take up to 5 minutes
    And the project will throw "you have exceeded you request" error and the page will shade with "development purposes only" at the second time you load project.html because of a certain billing policy
